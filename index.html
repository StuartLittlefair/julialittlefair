                    I will bring something for us to talk about (e.g. an article to read together, photos
                    to talk about together or a quiz). I will correct your mistakes during the English
                    lesson, but I will not give you any formal grammar, reading or writing exercises or
                    homework.

    <h2>What will my English class be like?</h2>
    <p>During your English class, I can provide topics to talk about or we can simply chat
        about things you enjoy. This will improve your confidence and fluency. We can
        also do exercises on pronunciation and learn new vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p><strong>I offer personalised English classes in Sheffield or online that are specially
            designed for you. We can work on anything you find challenging or hard.</strong></p>
    <p>Most of all, I hope you will find my English lessons really enjoyable and fun!</p>
    <h4>Inclusive English classes</h4>
    <p>If you are neurodivergent and you feel comfortable telling me, please do so. I can try to make sure the environment (noise,
        lighting) and the way we work together is best for you. See <a href="https://www.julialittlefair.uk/inclusivity">inclusivity page</a> for
        more details.</p>
