    <h2>Inclusivity</h2>
    <p>I am neurodivergent, and I am very welcoming if you are too. We can set things
        up to make sure you feel as comfortable and safe as possible. For example:
    <ul>
        <li>Sitting side-by-side so we don’t make eye contact;</li>
        <li>Learning English in a quiet place with dim lights;</li>
        <li>Taking regular breaks;</li>
        <li>Repeating information if you find it hard to concentrate;</li>
        <li>Having any comfort items you’d like with you (soft toys, blankets, favourite
            books etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    Learning English can be fun and exciting for <em>everyone</em> including you!
