                <p>"I had classes with Julia before I left the UK at the back end of 2022 and I
                    was pleased with her. Very professional and and she always made an effort to
                    correct my English. I do highly recommend her to anyone keen to improve their
                    English."</p>

                    "I have been having lessons with Julia for four years and the experience has
                    been outstanding. My speaking and listening skills have improved drastically. Julia
                    herself is very friendly and capable of understanding mistakes that carried over
                    from my first language. I highly recommend Julia if you need to improve your
                    English language skills"
